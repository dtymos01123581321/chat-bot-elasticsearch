👷‍♀️ TASK
Implement a chat application where each user can post questions &
answers in a chat room. We would also want for you to feature one
special member to that room - an awesome bot which should answer
questions that were already answered before.

⚙️ REQUIREMENTS
1. The application should be a single page which should focus on the
   chat room itself (no authentication, etc).
2. Use the following application skeleton based on node.js and lit. You are
   allowed to use any additional libraries.
   ❗ PAY ATTENTION TO
   Your challenge is to implement the above while thinking of the following:
1. 🤖 Core functionality - This is what the task is all about! Making a chat
   room with a bot. Remember how it must be able to answer questions
   which were already answered.
2. 🎨 Beautiful UI - Impress us with a breathtaking UI, you are welcome
   to use any library you want. We recommend checking Dribbble and
   Codepen as well as taking inspiration from everyday chats apps.
3. 🧱 Code Structure & Edge Cases - Think of how to structure the code
   so it would be robust and that you will be proud to present to us.
   💰 BONUS
1. Use ElasticSearch as a database and use smarter queries to find better
   matches for similar questions that were answered before.
2. We would appreciate a bot with an attitude - one that could make
   others laugh - an entertaining AI experience.
3. Creativity & Microinteractions - Think which features would enhance
   the users’ stay on the website and what microinteraction gestures
   could help.
